React Todo-App With API, is a task management application (ToDo) using React technologies and APIs
The project is based on the React JavaScript library, which allows you to build an interactive user interface. React uses a component-based approach, where each page element is represented by a separate component, which makes it easy to manage their states and behavior.

I also used the Application Programming Interface (API) to interact with the server and save data. With the help of the API, my program can perform operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. This allows you to store task data on the server and provides access to it from any device that has an Internet connection.

My project uses the following technologies:

React: for building the user interface and managing components.
JavaScript: a programming language for component interaction logic and data processing.
HTML/CSS: for the structure and styling of web pages.
API: for interacting with the server and exchanging data.
Git/GitHub: for version control and collaboration on the project.
This project allows you to create, view, update, and delete tasks using a web interface built on React. It uses APIs to save and retrieve task data. With this project, you can organize and manage your tasks from any device that has internet access.
